			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/Face.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Michael">

			<p>I am 49 years old and practiced medicine for most all of my adult life. I graduated from the University of Texas Medical School, Houston, in 1993. I successfully completed 2 years of residency in Pathology and Laboratory Medicine before changing to a Family Medicine Residency, which I completed in 1998. I practiced in Family Medicine for the next 13 years. </p>

			<p>In 2013, feeling burned out, I left my practice, and soon realized that I did not want to return. I spent the next 3 years pondering what it was I wanted to do with my life. I have long been interested in computers and coding and when I came across the UT Coding Bootcamp, I felt like it would be a good fit for me.</p>
